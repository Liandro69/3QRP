# Mythic Chairs
This is a port of tqrp_Sit that just had the ESX stuff removed.

Dependencies :
- [Mythic Notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify)

Original :
- [tqrp_sit](https://github.com/ESX-Org/tqrp_sit/)

> NOTE: This has no function to use as it's done through a command I have declared in my base script. Just add the Trigger below to a command or something and it'll work

```
TriggerClientEvent('mythic_chars:client:StartSit', source)
```
